## Requirements
	
- Modern Browsers ONLY (Preference to Chrome)

## Notes

This emulator uses WebGL for rendering, and WebRTC for netplay. Wanted to also use 
Web assembly but I don't think I will have time to implement it. This emulator can really only run
some test roms, Dr. Mario, and Tetris.  

## Credits

I'd like to credit the people that made, and maintain the [resources](RESOURCES.md) that I've used. I'd like to also thank
"Retro Game Mechanics Explained" youtube in helping me understand various complicated logic that occurs in SNES hardware.
